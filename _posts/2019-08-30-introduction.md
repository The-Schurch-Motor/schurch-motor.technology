### Poly-Polar Magnet Motor 

I am developing a [permanent magnet motor](/tags#PPMM) prototype intended for bicycles and wheelchairs. If it proves successful, as my proof-of-concept tests suggest, it will require far fewer batteries, weigh less, and have greater range than electromagnetic motor-based products. The system needs just enough to power the small 10W actuators, an arduino microcontroller, and bluetooth communications. 

Many academics believe permanent magnet motors are impossible. It's not impossible, just difficult. There are in fact a few working, patented permanent magnet motors, such as:

- [Reciprocating Permanent magnet drive apparatus](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8487484B1/en). [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoxyqxHYKBs)]

- A mechanism that shares some of the same principles, but is configured as a [linear-to-rotory transmission](https://www.magnamotorusa.com/) and not a motor. [[Video](https://www.magnamotorusa.com/video.html)]

My design is about 1000 pounds lighter than the units shown above -and possibly 100 times more efficient. It is less than 10 pounds and eliminates the inherent power loss of reciprocation. In contrast to electromagnetic motors, which increase efficiency when scaled up, permanent magnet motors increase efficiency when scaled down.

The machine looks deceptively simple, but the magnets used are not ordinary; they are quadripolar. My design makes possible Halbach-like magnet array effects, activating and neutralizing net magnetic forces under computer control.
