At heart, I'm an inventor-philosopher. 

### Career history

My career started as a Russian linguist in military intelligence, primarily in the domains of science and aerospace engineering. For a good 15 years I worked with SQL databases and data engineering. For the last 10 years, I've also been doing volunteer work as a translator to and from Brazilian Portuguese.

Note: I decided to name the motor after the original Swiss-German spelling of my family name, mostly because I think it has a better connoation than the Americanized version.
